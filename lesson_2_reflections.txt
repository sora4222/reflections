Initializing a repository is what is
needed for setting up the git bash
to function correctly and track changes.

The staging area represents the 
files that are being tracked by git. The
working directory is all files in the 
directory. The repository is the metadata
storing all of this information.

Branches would be useful when I or a team
member wants to change the software 
without causing damage, or they want to 
make fixes, or add more features.

Gits automatic merging is much quicker,
however it is only really possible for it
to function when things are clear cut and 
there is changed in one and changed in
the other.
